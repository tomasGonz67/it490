# IT490

So this project is getting scratched. The main repo is all code I wrote BEFORE the midterm due date.

The "tomas" branch is code that Luke worked on and includes his contributions, which include his work on the DMZ and the email function. Luke was also responsible for the zero-tier part of this project and helped a lot with some of the configurations on our VMs. 

PS- I should have named it the "luke" branch. But accidentally swithched the two lol.
